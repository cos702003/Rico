Eboard Slideshow Viewer
	This program is a python derivative of the original Eboard program coded for Rico.
	It will grab an image served from a definable webpage and display it to the screen as a slideshow.
	The program makes use of a ramdrive for faster image swapping and to reduce writes to the SDCard.
	Please follow the directions below for proper installation and operation of the program.

	1) Install Raspbian Stretch to RasPi
	2) Edit the following file to disable screensaver mode on Pi:
			/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
	   and add the following lines to the end:
			@xset s noblank
			@xset s off
			@xset -dpms
	   then save the file.
	3) Create a ramdisk by entering the following commands in terminal:
	  		sudo mkdir /var/ramdisk
			sudo nano /etc/fstab
				Enter the following lines to the fstab file:
				tmpfs /var/ramdisk tmpfs nodev,nosuid,size=4M 0 0
			sudo mount -a
	4) Type "df" in terminal to confirm the ramdisk is eady to use.
	   You should see a "tmpfs" file system mounted on /var/ramdisk
	5) Copy the Eboard_Rev2.pyw file to the preferred [PATH].
